    <meta name="description" content="SLIIT uses a comprehensive grading system to assess student performance, including 12 distinct grades: A+ (4.0, 90-100), A (4.0, 80-89), A- (3.7, 75-79), B+ (3.3, 70-74), B (3.0, 65-69), B- (2.7, 60-64), C+ (2.3, 55-59), C (2.0, 45-54), C- (1.7, 40-44), D+ (1.3, 35-39), D (1.0, 30-34), and E (0.0, 0-29), with “C” being the pass grade. A Conceded Pass (PC) grade may be awarded by the Institute upon Senate's recommendation for some undergraduate programs, and it does not affect the numeric marks. The D pass requires passing all modules in the 1st attempt, having only one pending module, a grade of D/D+/C-, and a GPA of 2.00 or above (excluding English modules), and is not available for students in the Faculty of Humanities and Sciences. SLIIT computes the Weighted Grade Point Average (WGPA) by multiplying grade points with the number of credits for each course and dividing by the total credits, with different weightings for each faculty: School of Business (10%, 20%, 30%, 40%), Faculty of Computing (0%, 20%, 30%, 50%), and Faculty of Engineering (10%, 20%, 30%, 40%). WGPA is used to determine class awards for students from the 2017 intake onwards. For students in the Faculty of Humanities and Sciences (FHS), CGPA computation follows the same grading system, and tools like the FoC_GPA Calculator and FHS_GPA Calculator help students instantly calculate their GPA and plan academic progress to aim for honors and improve performance.">
